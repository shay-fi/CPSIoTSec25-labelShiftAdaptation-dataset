Traffic data for our CPSIoTSec'25 paper.

Each folder corresponds to one of the 12 smart home subscribers from which data is collected. Data corresponding to the "representative home" chiefly discussed in the paper can be found under ./home04. 

In each folder can be found the full training data, ``train.csv`` (collected between October 20, 2020 to November 20, 2020), the full test data ``test.csv`` (collected between November 20, 2020 to December 6, 2020). There also exists another folder in each home's data folder containing 8 csv files each corresponding to an sliding window derived from the full test dataset. Each window captures 7 days of test data, with the first window starting on the initial day of the test period. Subsequent windows are generated by shifting the start of the previous window forward by one day.

Each CSV file contains 23 columns -- 22 for flow-level traffic features and one column for the class label. The flow-level features are YAF-exported [IPFIX Information Elements](https://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/docs.html#yaf-3-rec-tmpl). Here we brieflt explain the features. 

- **packetTotalCount**: Number of transmitted packets.
- **octetTotalCount**: Number of transmitted Bytes.
- **smallPacketCount**: Number of packet with less than 60 Bytes of payload.
- **largePacketCount**: Number of packet with at least 220 Bytes of payload.
- **nonEmptyPacketCount**: Number of packets with non-empty payload.
- **firstNonEmptyPacketSize**: Number of Bytes in the payload of the first non-empty packet.
- **dataByteCount**: Number of payload Bytes transmitted.
- **averageInterarrivalTime**: The average of the packet interarrival times (milliseconds).
- **maxPacketSize**: The largest payload size in Bytes. 
- **standardDeviationPayloadLength**: The standard deviation of payload size (Bytes) for up to first 10 non-empty packets.
- **standardDeviationInterarrivalTime**: The standard deviation of interarrival times (milliseconds) for up to first 10 packets.
