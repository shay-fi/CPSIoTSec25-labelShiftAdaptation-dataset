Traffic data for our CPSIoTSec'25 paper.

The data constitutes flow metadata for 638,136 TCP/443 flows pertaining 17 IoT make-and-models, collected from 12 smart home subscribers. The dataset is organized into 12 folders, each corresponding to one of the 12 subscribers. Data corresponding to the "representative home" chiefly discussed in the paper can be found under ./home04. 

In each folder can be found the full training data, ``train.csv`` (collected between October 20, 2020 and November 20, 2020), the full test data ``test.csv`` (collected between November 20, 2020 and December 6, 2020). There also exists another folder in each home's data folder containing 8 csv files each corresponding to an sliding window derived from the full test dataset. Each window captures 7 days of test data, with the first window starting on the initial day of the test period. Subsequent windows are generated by shifting the start of the previous window forward by one day.

Each CSV file contains 23 columns -- 22 for flow-level traffic features and one column for the class label. The flow-level features are YAF-exported [IPFIX Information Elements](https://tools.netsa.cert.org/yaf/docs.html#yaf-3-rec-tmpl). Here we brieflt explain the features.  

There are 11 forward features measured on packets directed from the flow initiating end to the other:
- **packetTotalCount**: Number of packets.
- **octetTotalCount**: Number of Bytes.
- **smallPacketCount**: Number of packet with less than 60 Bytes of payload.
- **largePacketCount**: Number of packet with at least 220 Bytes of payload.
- **nonEmptyPacketCount**: Number of packets with non-empty payload.
- **firstNonEmptyPacketSize**: Number of Bytes in the payload of the first non-empty packet.
- **dataByteCount**: Number of payload Bytes transmitted.
- **averageInterarrivalTime**: The average of the packet interarrival times (milliseconds).
- **maxPacketSize**: The largest payload size in Bytes. 
- **standardDeviationPayloadLength**: The standard deviation of payload size (Bytes) for up to the first 10 non-empty packets.
- **standardDeviationInterarrivalTime**: The standard deviation of interarrival times (milliseconds) for up to the first 10 packets,

and 11 reverse features measured based on packet sents in the reverse direction:
- **reversePacketTotalCount**,
- **reverseOctetTotalCount**,
- **reverseSmallPacketCount**,
- **reverseLargePacketCount**,
- **reverseNonEmptyPacketCount**,
- **reverseFirstNonEmptyPacketSize**,
- **reverseDataByteCount**,
- **reverseAverageInterarrivalTime**,
- **reverseMaxPacketSize**,
- **reverseStandardDeviationPayloadLength**,
- **reverseStandardDeviationInterarrivalTime**.
